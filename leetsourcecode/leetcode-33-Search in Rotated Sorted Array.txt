/*leetcode-33-Search in Rotated Sorted Array
     Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
     (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
     You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
     You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.*/
     int search(vector<int>& nums, int target)
     {
         int len = nums.size();
         if (len == 0)return -1;
         for (int i = 0; i < len;i++)
         {
             if (nums[i] == target)return i;              
         }
         return -1;
     }

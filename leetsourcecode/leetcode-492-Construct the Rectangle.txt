/*leetcode-492-Construct the Rectangle
 For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So,
 given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, 
 whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.*/
vector<int> constructRectangle(int area)
{
        int L,W;
	vector<int>ret;
	float a = sqrt(area);
	if(abs(a - int(a))<0.001) L=W=int(a);
	else
	{
	  L = int(a)+1,W = int(a);
	  while(L*W  != area)
	  {
	    if(L*W < area)L++;
	    else W--;
	  }	  
	}
	ret.push_back(L);
	ret.push_back(W);
	return ret;
}

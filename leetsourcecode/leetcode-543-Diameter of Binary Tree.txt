/*leetcode-543-Diameter of Binary Tree
     Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree.
     The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
     This path may or may not pass through the root.
     Example:
     Given a binary tree
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
     Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].*/
     int height(TreeNode* root, int& diameter)
     {
         if (root == NULL) return 0;
         int left = height(root->left, diameter);
         int right = height(root->right, diameter);
         diameter = max(diameter, left + right);
         return 1 + max(left, right);
     }
     int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root)
     {
         int diameter = 0;
         height(root, diameter);
         return diameter;
     }
